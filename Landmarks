// to update how a landmark is announced, use an aria-label

//proper
$('nav.sqs-svg-icon--list')
  .attr('aria-label', 'Social Media');

//why this doesn't work:
$('nav.sqs-svg-icon--list')
  .attr('aria-label', 'Social Media Navigation');
// since this has the element <nav>, if I leave as is - this will announce navigation twice
