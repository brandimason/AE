//breakdown
the function you provided dynamically checks for all <img> elements with an alt attribute within a specific scope (ele) and performs actions based on their attributes. Here's a breakdown of what the function is doing:

Key Steps in the Function:
Selection and Iteration:

It uses .outerFind('img[alt]') to find all <img> elements with an alt attribute in the specified scope (ele).
Then, it iterates over each <img> using .each().
Comparison of Adjacent Images:

For each <img>:
$current is the current image element.
$next is the next sibling <img> with an alt attribute (.next('img[alt]')).
It checks if $next exists and if the alt attribute of $current is the same as the alt attribute of $next.
Action Based on src Attributes:

If the src attributes of $current and $next are the same:
The alt attribute of $next is set to an empty string ('').
If the src attributes are different:
The alt attribute of $next is modified by appending " (2)" to it.
Purpose:
The function ensures that:

Duplicate Accessible Names:
If two adjacent images have the same alt text, and the same src, it removes the alt from the second image (likely to avoid redundancy for screen readers).
If two adjacent images have the same alt but different src, it appends " (2)" to the alt of the second image to make it distinguishable.
Dynamic Nature:
Yes, this function dynamically processes the page because:

It directly operates on the DOM elements currently within the scope of ele.
It adapts to changes in the DOM (e.g., if new <img> elements are added) as long as the function is called again.
Considerations:
Scope:
The .outerFind() method suggests that it might be a custom or library-specific function; ensure it is equivalent to .find() or functions as intended in your code.
Efficiency:
If the page contains many images or is updated frequently, consider performance implications.
Accessibility Impact:
Ensure the logic aligns with accessibility guidelines and doesn't inadvertently remove necessary alt attributes.


//option 2:
ele.outerFind('img[alt]').each(function (index) {
  var $current = $ae(this);
  var $next = $ae(this).next('img[alt]');
  if ($next.length && $current.attr('alt') === $next.attr('alt')) {
    if ($current.attr('src') === $next.attr('src')) {
      $next.attr('alt', '');
    } else {
      var currentAlt = $current.attr('alt');
      $current.attr('alt', currentAlt + ' (1 of 2)');
      $next.attr('alt', currentAlt + ' (2 of 2)');
    }
  }
});
